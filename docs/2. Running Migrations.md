# Running Migrations

Whenever you pull changes from the repository, you should run the migrations to update the database schema. This is done by running the following command:

1. Switch to Backend Folder

   ```bash
   cd Backend
   ```

2. Run Migrations
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```
